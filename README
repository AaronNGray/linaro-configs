This repository contains the Jenkins job configurations used by Linaro CI.

Jenkins job builder
===================

Jenkins Job Builder takes simple descriptions of Jenkins jobs in YAML format,
and uses them to configure Jenkins.

Configurations
==============

In order to keep the jobs consistent, please follow this guideline:
 * Job name
   - lower case
   - avoid spacing
 * YAML
   - file name matching the job name

TODO
====
 * YAML header contains maintainer name
 * enable markdown formatter
